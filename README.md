# react-odometer


**Author**: Raven Delaney
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Intro to React JS - build an odometer page that shows 4 digits(padded with zeros) and can be incremented by 1, 10, 100, and 1000

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
I created and cloned a repo onto my local machine into the terminal. Once in the terminal I created a react app and used VS code to write it. 
In the repo on your local machine, run `npm run build`, and what is currently completed will open in local host
If you leave the server, use command `npm start` to reopen it

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
This was built entirely in the command line and VS code using React. 

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
